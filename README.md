# Trading Algorithms and Data Enhancement Tools

This repository contains a collection of advanced trading algorithms and tools for financial data analysis. These scripts are designed to interact with APIs (such as Alpaca) and utilize machine learning models for forecasting stock prices and making trading decisions.

## 1. **Trader (MLTrader)**
This is the main trading algorithm that performs technical analysis and sentiment analysis for stock trading decisions. It uses a multi-factor composite score based on indicators like RSI, MACD, and Ichimoku Cloud, and dynamically sizes positions using the Average True Range (ATR). 

### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrated FinBERT model for news sentiment estimation.
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, and Ichimoku Cloud used for buy/sell signals.
- **Backtesting**: Supports cross-validation over parameter grids for weights on the indicators.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Risk-based sizing based on cash-at-risk and ATR.
  
Usage: Adjust API credentials, symbols, and cash settings directly in the script.

## 2. **getSentiment.py**
This script provides sentiment analysis based on FinBERT, which is fine-tuned for financial news data. It is used to estimate sentiment and probability from news articles.

### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Labels**: Outputs "positive", "neutral", or "negative" sentiment.
- **Integration**: Used by the Trader algorithm to refine buy/sell decisions.

Usage: Sentiment can be estimated using the `estimate_sentiment(news)` function by passing a list of news headlines.

## 3. **getData.py**
Fetches and preprocesses historical stock data from Alpaca's API. It retrieves minute-level data, resamples it to 30-minute intervals, and exports it as a CSV for further analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Alpaca API Integration**: Downloads historical data for selected symbols.
- **Resampling**: Converts high-frequency minute data to lower-frequency intervals.

Usage: API credentials must be provided. You can adjust the date range and symbol as needed.

## 4. **ARIMA.py**
This script enhances the data obtained from `getData.py` by fitting an ARIMA model. It performs differencing and grid search over ARIMA parameters for forecasting future stock prices.

### Key Features:
- **Differencing**: Automatic differencing based on ADF test results.
- **Model Selection**: Auto ARIMA model selection based on grid search.
- **Residual Analysis**: Includes stationarity checks and residual diagnostic plots.

Usage: Specify the dataset path, and the script will output model parameters, forecasts, and residual plots.

## 5. **LSTM.py**
This script trains an LSTM model on historical stock price data, predicting future prices over multiple time horizons (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10 days). It includes hyperparameter tuning and evaluates the model using RMSE.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-step Forecasting**: Predicts prices for multiple future time steps.
- **Grid Search**: Optimizes LSTM architecture and learning rates.
- **Visualization**: Plots actual vs predicted prices for better interpretability.

Usage: The data should be preprocessed using `getData.py`. You can configure hyperparameters directly in the script.

## Sample Dataset

A small sample dataset has been included in this repository under the `Data.csv` file. You can use this dataset to try out the code without needing to fetch external data or configure an API. This allows you to test and experiment with the algorithms right away.
